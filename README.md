Leaf DevTools provides a set of tools for debugging and understanding your Leaf applications. At the Core, the DevTools provides a visual tool with a clean and intuitive UI holding information about your Leaf application, and a light-weight library that you can use to interact with the devtools frontend.

## Basic Usage

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

\Leaf\DevTools::install();

app()->get('/', function () {
  response()->json([
    'message' => 'Welcome!'
  ]);
});

app()->run();
```

After this, you can access the devtools at `<app-url>/leafDevTools`. For your own convenience, you can add a route to the devtools like so:

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

\Leaf\DevTools::install('/customDevToolsRoute');

...
```

This will serve the devtools at `<app-url>/customDevToolsRoute`.
